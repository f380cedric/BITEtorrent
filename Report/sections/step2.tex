\subsection{Description of the objective}

This step consists of the addition of the tracker. It will provide the client the list of chunks and the peers that own each chunk. The client will thus not have to fetch this information in a configuration file but still needs it to know the IP address and port number of the tracker.

\subsection{Proposed solution}

The \texttt{tracker} class now implements the reading of the configuration file as the client did in step 1, in order to know the addresses, ports and chunks of the peers.

When a request is sent by the client to the tracker, all the file information is sent in a message. According to the content of this message, the list of chunks are placed in the adequate queues (only Alice, only Bob or owned by both). The follow-up is exactly the same as it was in step 1.
