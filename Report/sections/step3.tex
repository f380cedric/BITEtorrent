\subsection{Description of the objective}

The last step consists of modifying the client and the tracker in such a way that the client will not need a configuration file anymore. The client will instead try to discover the tracker by sending a broadcast message, and the tracker should respond to these discover requests.

\subsection{Proposed solution}

When launched, the tracker is listening to broadcast messages (UDP) and to TCP request, in separated threads. This broadcast message is sent by the client when wanting to start a file download. The message is sent using UDP because this protocol does not require an established connection between the two agents.
