The BitTorrent-like service is working without any trouble. It handles the cases where the chunk are supposed to be owned by two peers but are not, and should be working if the connection has to be established with more than two peers.

Thanks to the use of \texttt{Threads} and \texttt{Queues}, the file transfer is as fast as possible with a TCP connection.
